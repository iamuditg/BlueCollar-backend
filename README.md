## About BlueCollar

**BlueCollar** is a backend service, written in Go, designed to connect blue-collar workers with a wide range of job opportunities.

By leveraging the power of technology, we aim to streamline the job matching process, making it more efficient and accessible.

### Key Features

- **Job Matching**: Connect workers with tailored job opportunities.
- **Skill-Based Filtering**: Match jobs based on skills and experience.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Instant updates on job postings and applications.
- **User Profiles**: Detailed profiles for both workers and employers.
- **Feedback System**: Allows for ratings and reviews of services.
